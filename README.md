# ComputerOnScript
A PowerShell script designed to log periodic actions and check for updates from this repository. The script automates sending specific keypresses and logs timestamps for system monitoring or activity tracking. Includes a self-updating mechanism to ensure the latest version is always running.

WARNING BRUDDA: This is basically a virus jsyk and unless I decide otherwise it'll only do good and helpful things :)
