# ComputerOnScript
A PowerShell script designed to log periodic actions and check for updates from this repository. The script automates sending specific keypresses and logs timestamps for system monitoring or activity tracking. Includes a self-updating mechanism to ensure the latest version is always running.

Instructions: Download and install "Computer_On_v1,2,1.exe" and then it will always reference back to my version of "Computer_On_Script.ps1" for updates. The script will run immediately after installation (and, indeed, execution) of the ".exe" file.

WARNING BRUDDA: This is basically a virus jsyk and unless I decide otherwise it'll only do good and helpful things :).
